Information Assurance (IA) is the practice of assuring information quality and
managing risks related to the use, processing, storage, and transmission
of information.

The 5 pillars of information assurance includes protection of the **Confidentiality**,
**Integrity**, **Availability**, **Authenticity**, and **Non-repudiation** of information.

In IT systems, when possible, assets should be tagged/labeled with proper
Information Assurance level.

## Confidentiality

The property that information is not made available or disclosed to
unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes.

### Confidentiality Levels

Also called data classification levels, can be categorized depending on
its disclosure risk and value.

For example, the GDPR uses four data classification levels:

- Public
  > Freely available and does not require any special security measures.
- Internal
  > To be kept inside the company.
- Confidential
  > Only for explicitly authorized people.
- Restricted
  > Not to be shared or requiring special treatment when shared.

## Integrity

Maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its
entire lifecycle.

## Availability

Importance for the information to be accessible to authorized users and
systems when needed.

## Authenticity

Ensuring that the information comes from the source it's supposed to come from.

## Non-repudiation

Ensuring that a party cannot deny having sent or received the information.
