## About Me

Hi there! My name is Duilio Ruggiero.

I'm a pragmatic software engineer with many years of experience in software
development and infrastructure automation.

My passion for infrastructure automation started more than 20 years ago ( back
then I mainly used Bash and Perl scripts). I have been using Terraform/OpenTofu
and Ansible (and Puppet, Chef, and others before them) for **Infrastructure as Code**
(IaC) for many years, both at work, mostly to manage AWS infrastructure and
services (EC2, ECS, EKS, RDS, IAM Identity Center, S3, Route53, to name a few),
and in my home-lab (for bare-metal, Kubernetes, CloudStack, etc.), and many CI/CD
systems (usually in a GitOps workflow).

I started programming when I was a kid on a [Commodore VIC-20][vic20] and over
the years I used many (too many to list) programming languages.

Lately the languages I use most are **Elixir**, **Go**, **Python**, and **Ruby**.
I started using Ruby at the beginning of 2005 when Rails was still in beta (if I
remember correctly, was [Rails 0.9.5][rails-095]) and have been using it for more
than 10 years, but have moved on to using more and more Elixir for web development
(started playing with it in 2014 and using it in production in 2015) and Python and
Go for CLIs.

Being a pragmatist, I know that software is a tool, and for that reason I never
stopped learning related topics that were not specifically technical, like
project management approaches (I started being interested in Agile methodologies
in 2006) and Governance, Risk management and Compliance ([GRC](/categories/grc/)).

The interest in GRC only showed up in the last few years, when my passion for
identity management met my passion for automation and security, and is probably
"fault" of friends in the Information Security and Cyber Security teams and my
work on Identity and Access Management (**IAM**) and Identity Governance and
Administration (**IGA**).

If you are curious about the origin of the name `Sinetris`, it comes from a
character I created almost 30 years ago for a tabletop RPG (I think it was
[Vampire: The Masquerade][vampire-masquerade]) and have been using ever since.
