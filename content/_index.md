## About Me

Hi there! My name is Duilio Ruggiero.

I am a pragmatist, I know that software is a tool, and for that reason I never
stopped learning related topics that were not specifically technical, like
project management approaches (I started being interested in Agile methodologies
in 2006) and Governance, Risk management and Compliance (GRC).

The interest in GRC only showed up in the last few years, when my passion for
identity management met my passion for automation and security, and is probably
“fault” of friends in the Information Security and Cyber Security teams and my
work on Identity and Access Management (**IAM**) and Identity Governance and
Administration (**IGA**).

Regarding my passion for automation, I have used Terraform/OpenTofu and Ansible
(and Puppet, Chef, and others before them) for Infrastructure as Code (**IaC**)
for many years, both at work, mostly to manage AWS infrastructure and services
(EC2, ECS, EKS, RDS, IAM Identity Center, S3, Route53, to name a few), and in my
home-lab for Kubernetes on bare-metal and CloudStack, and many CI/CD systems
(usually using a GitOps workflow).

Over the years I have used many (too many to list) programming languages. Lately
the ones I use most are **Elixir**, **Go**, **Python**, and **Ruby**. I started
using Ruby in 2005 and have been using it for more than 10 years, but have moved
on to using more and more Elixir (started playing with it in 2014) for web
development and Python and Go for CLIs.
